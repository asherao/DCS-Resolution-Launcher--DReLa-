# DCS-Resolution-Launcher--DReLa-
Welcome to DReLa (DCS Resolution Launcher). This utility is created to enable users to choose the game resolution right before the game launches. Created for mission makers, those who want to play on a different screen, or those who simply want to change
their DCS resolution without launching DCS twice.

Have you ever launched DCS to only realize that you launched it in the wrong resolution for whatever reason? Mabye testing, or you are on a different monitor, or you donâ€™t feel like using triple screen today? Well, this is the utility for you! Launch DReLa, choose your resolution and go!

Hello and welcome to DCS Resolution Launcher (DReLa).
This program creates and modifies files on your computer. If you are not ok with that, please do not use this utility.
1. Select your DCS.exe file. It is usually located in C:\Install Location\DCS World\bin
2. Select your options.lua file. It is usually located in C:\Users\YOURNAME\Saved Games\DCS\Config. 
3. Select a preset resolution. DCS will automatically launch. Or...
4. Enter a custom resolution and click Launch with Custom Res. 
5. Right before DCS launches, DReLa will save your settings in a text file in the location of this application. The next time you run the program you won't have to set the DCS and options.lua paths.
