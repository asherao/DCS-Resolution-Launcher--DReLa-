# DCS-Resolution-Launcher--DReLa-
Updated for VR in V5! Have you ever launched DCS to only realize that you launched it in the wrong resolution for whatever reason? Maybe testing, mission making, or you are on a different monitor, or you donâ€™t feel like using triple screen today? Well, this is the utility for you! Launch DReLa, choose your resolution, and enjoy DCS without having to launch DCS twice.

Hello and welcome to DCS Resolution Launcher (DReLa).
This program creates and modifies files on your computer. If you are not ok with that, please do not use this utility.
1. Select your DCS.exe file. It is usually located in C:\Install Location\DCS World\bin
2. Select your options.lua file. It is usually located in C:\Users\YOURNAME\Saved Games\DCS\Config. 
3. If you want to launch DCS in VR, click the 'Launch DCS VR' button.
4. If you want to launch DCS in flatscreen, pick a resolution or enter a custom resolution and click 'Add Custom Resolution'. DReLa will save your resolution and file locations you picked earlier.
5. Click 'Launch DCS'. Right before DCS launches, DReLa will edit your 'options.lua' and save your settings in a text file in the location of this application. The next time you run the program you won't have to set the DCS and 'options.lua' paths and your custom resolutions will be there for you.

(Advanced/Experenced Users only) You can pick your 'Monitor.lua. DReLa will attempt to find the correct dectories and will list the detected 'multiMonitorSetup' lua files. This is completely optional and only intended for users who have a specific and known reason to use this feature (eg, they make a Monitor.lua that renders the GUI in a different location when using a certain resolution.)
